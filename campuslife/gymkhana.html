								<p>The Student Gymkhana at IIT (ISM) Dhanbad is a recent initiative with a primary objective of giving students a role in the academic and administrative governance of the institute, which would in turn help in inculcating leadership and management qualities in the students. 
								<br>
								The Student Gymkhana activities, although subordinate to academic activities, constitute pretty much everything encompassed by the term ‘co-curricular’, entirely managed and organized by the students themselves. The students can choose to be part of it by standing in the annual Gymkhana elections held at the end of March accompanied by proper campaigns, soap boxes, manifestos, booths and the like. 
								<br>
								The elected candidates would thereby be privileged to be a part of the Senate with a one-year tenure, that ends on the 31st of March every year. </p>
