                <strong>1.Universal testing machines :</strong><br><br>
                The most common testing machines are universal testers, which test materials in tension or compression. Their primary function is to create the stress strain curve. Testing machines are either electromechanical or hydraulic. The principal difference is the method by which the load is applied. Electromechanical machines are based on a variable-speed electric motor; a gear reduction system; and one, two, or four screws that move the crosshead up or down. This motion loads the specimen in tension or compression. Crosshead speeds can be changed by changing the speed of the motor. A microprocessor-based closed-loop servo system can be implemented to accurately control the speed of the crosshead. Hydraulic testing machines are based on either a single or dual-acting piston that moves the crosshead up or down. However, most static hydraulic testing machines have a single acting piston or ram. In a manually operated machine, the operator adjusts the orifice of a pressure-compensated needle valve to control the rate of loading. In a closed-loop hydraulic servo system, the needle valve is replaced by an electrically operated servo valve for precise control.
