		 		<h3>About Department</h3><hr>
		 		<p>Welcome to the Department of Fuel and Mineral Engineering</p>
				 
				 <p>The Department of Fuel and Mineral Engineering was founded in the year 1976 to address the
              processing issues of the minerals (metallic, non-metallic and fuel). It started with DISM and M Tech
              courses in Mineral Engineering and in Fuel Engineering. The department launched a B Tech program
              in Mineral Engineering with a grant of Rs. 4.2 crores from the Ministry of Mines (MOM), Government
              of India in 1984. This unique program has produced graduates who are well absorbed in the industry
              by organisations like CIL, HZL, NMDC, SAIL, Tata Steel, Monnet Ispat, Aryan Coal Beneficiation, JSPL
              and JSW among others. Other major recruiters of Mineral Engineering graduates include BHP
              Billiton, Evalueserve, PWC, Outotec, Metso Minerals, Hatch, Bateman, Humboldt Wedag, McNally
              Bharat, MN Dastur etc. Apart from B Tech Mineral Engineering, the department also offers dual
              degree programs by adding M Tech in Mineral Processing and MBA to the B Tech Mineral
              Engineering course for students interested in higher levels of Mineral Engineering and management
              respectively. The traditional M Tech programs in Mineral Engineering and Fuel Engineering continue
              to be offered with revised course structure, keeping in pace with the present scenario, along with
              the PhD programs.
